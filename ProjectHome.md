We all get overwhelmed with communication channels, from IM to phone calls, but the worst offender is email. Some people get hundreds of legitimate emails a day. This is already on top of the unwanted spam! So how do we make the most out of cutting through email to [inbox zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero) and getting to only the messages that need attention. When the inbox gets too long, then it is time for email triage.

[Triage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage) is a medical term used to describe desperate situations where the doctor needs to make snap decisions that are not always in an individual's best interest, but in the interest of the catastrophe at hand. When performing triage in a medical emergency all patients fall into 1 of 4 categories. Your inbox is no different, each message can be acted upon in 1 of the same 4 ways.
